</h1>


The aim of this book is to introduce Python to those with little or very little programming knowledge, and then to take them through to become an experienced Python developer.

Each chapter has a brief introduction, the main body of the chapter, followed by a
list of (typically) online references that can be used for further reading.
Following this, there is typically an Exercises section that lists one or more
exercises that build on the skills you will have learned in that chapter.
Sample solutions to the exercises are available in a GitHub online repository that
supports this book.
